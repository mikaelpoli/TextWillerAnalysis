	- score: Polarity score. Range = -1, +1 where -1 = negative polarity and +1 = positive polarity. Words are classified as either negative (-1) or positive (+1). Emojis are classified using the full range of values (with 0 = neutral). Emoji scores were calulated using Gupta, Singh, and Ranjan's (2021) procedure as illustrated in "Emoji Score and Polarity Evaluation Using CLDR Short Name and Expression Sentiment" (doi:10.1007/978-3-030-73689-7): 1) Polarity scores for 676 emojis were retreived from lexicon::emojis_sentiment (Rinker, 2019), a slightly modified version of Novak, Smailovic, Sluban, & Mozetic's (2015) emoji sentiment data (doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0144296) ; 2) Using VADER (Roehrick, 2020), an additional polarity score was calculated for all 1853 emojis through a sentiment analysis of their CLDR short name; 3) The final polarity score therefore is: the VADER score for emojis that do not appear in lexicon::emojis_sentiment (n = 1177); the arithmetic mean of the VADER and lexicon::emojis_sentiment scores for the remaining emojis (n = 676). All emojis were retrieved from: http://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html. Type: numeric.
